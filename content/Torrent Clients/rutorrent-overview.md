Title: ruTorrent Overview
Description: A brief introduction to the ruTorrent web UI
*/

The dynamic pair of rTorrent and ruTorrent make one heck of a client, for users of all experience levels. The rTorrent program runs on the server, in the background, all the time, while the ruTorrent script allows you to control rTorrent from your browser. Let's examine the two pieces separately.

## ruTorrent

An opens-source project written mostly in PHP that allows you to control rTorrent from the comfort of your favorite web browser. If you're familiar with uTorrent on the Windows or Mac desktop, or with Deluge GTK, this will seem pretty comfortable.

The disk graph in the bottom right is a reflection of how much disk quota you have used or have left. Here's a quick explanation of the icons in the menu bar and what they do:
